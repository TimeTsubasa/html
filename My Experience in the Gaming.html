<h3>My Experience in the Gaming</h3>
<p>Playing games, finding more solutions are hard.</p>
<p>Designing games is hard, as you need to think about more possibilites and behaviors than players. <br>
When you think about games, things appear in your mind are difficulties and challengings, as they expand the imagary bound of human. <br>
no matter how much difficult each game is, I learn a lot in the experience of gaming.</p> <br>

<p>Honestly, I didn't play a variey of games. Games I dived in playing were Dress-Up Games Miracle Nikki, Shinning Nikki, 3D Action Game Punishing, turn-based Yu-Gi-Oh! Card Game Honkai3: Star Rail, and Open-World Games like The Adventure of Zelda: Breath of  the Wind and Genshin Impact. After playing these games, I started to learn some lessons of game designing and found out different pespectives in the designing experience. Here are how they come: </p>

<h4>First, Components Thinking and Systematic Thinking</h4>
<p>Everything is made of components, even though the Atom is made of a Atomic nucleus and electrons. When I get the idea of component thinking, I comprehend the world clearly and less-stressful. I start to overcome the fear of physics and chemistry and make the advanced learning experience easier, and I find that I am able to memorize passages without the help of Google Map, and the Periodic Table of Elements as well. With the component thinking, I am eager to build everything I want, such as the machine, the romantic theater, the music stage, etc.. I find myself start to configue the small village or the city, to add different characters with different status and personalities into the city. Also, it is not just to simply put many things together. Systematic thinking allows me  to organize these components efficiently and fluently and to avoid some conflicts.  Componetns gathering will create networks and connections, and the system is able to operate automatically. When it comes to the Unvisiable Hand, I think it can be the system. When the system itself fails to organize all components correctly, it needs the outside forces to update it into the new system.</p> 

<p><strong>Secondly, narrative storytellings are differnt with poeple.</strong> People have different descriptions or narratives of the same component. In this case, it's very necessary to do the research to find out the target audience to better serve their needs. For instance, people who don't enjoy love will not favor the the Love Chasing game, and people who love cat also enjoy the Cat-Caring Game, and some adults who want to experience the high school again will immerse themself in the school-life simulation game. </p>

<h4>Thirdly, Situational Thinking. </h4>
<p>People face different situations every day. Some are easy-to-overcome while some are challenging. How to handle these daily situations better? Gaming can be seen as the Situation Simulator to guide us to solve problems. These settings can be more or less challeging than the real-world situation we  are now facing, or the setting with more tips for us to explore. For example, if we don't know how to start with the foreign language, imagine the setting that your nearby is filled with people speaking that language. You feel learning Chinese is hard, it is an idea to set the situation that you are  surrounded by Chinese poeple who are warm to teach your Chinese characters and coversations. For people who really want to solve problems and get things down, resourses will come to him/her to guide him/her towards surccess. </p>

<p><strong>Forthfully, Failures are everywhere, but don't be afraid,</strong> because the timeline will cure our hearts. The tree of storylines. Storylines of the other branch of the tree will never happen in the real world, but it will not stop us to find other approchings and possibilities of the other lines to better make the future decisions. Things we can still change are next steps and future decisions, so gaming is very helpful to make the better ourselves. Failure is not afradable, but the stopping heart is. </p>

<p><strong>Every product needs to be playtested and iterated multiple times before final publishing. </strong>No products are perfect, even when it comes to the publishing date. Therefore, it is very necessary to playtest the product and update accordingly to get closer to the better performance. Different players have different behaviors and approaches to reach the target, so designers and directors need to think about these possible and underlying behaviors to update the desgining world to make it to be more objective.</p>

<p>These are my serveral takeaways from the lessons of game designing. Just like the AI, it will be the useful and powerful tool to help us make better ourselves and get closer to our dreams.  </p>
